# ROS2 & PX4 Precision Landing with ArUco Markers
Master the integration of ROS2, PX4, and OpenCV to achieve precision landing using ArUco marker detection. This tutorial delves into how to leverage ROS2's robust communication framework and PX4's flight control system to implement highly accurate landings for autonomous drones. You'll learn how to configure your environment, process camera feeds, and detect ArUco markers in real-time, enabling your drone to land precisely at designated targets. Whether you're new to drone development or an experienced engineer, this guide provides a step-by-step approach to achieving reliable precision landing with seamless integration into your ROS2 and PX4 projects.
#### ArUco Markers
Aruco markers are square fiducial markers used in computer vision for tasks like pose estimation, camera calibration, and augmented reality (AR). Each marker has a unique binary pattern inside a black border, allowing it to be easily detected and identified. They help in determining the position and orientation of cameras or objects in a scene, making them valuable in robotics, navigation, and AR applications.
